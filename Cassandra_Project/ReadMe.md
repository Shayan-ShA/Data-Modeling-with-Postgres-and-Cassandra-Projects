A startup called <b>Sparkify</b> wants to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

The aim is to create a Cassandra Database and an ETL pipeline to optimize queries for song play analysis.

<h2>Project Description </h2>

In this project, I modeled a dataset with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I modeled the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I also created an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
