<h1>Data Modeling with Postgres and Cassandra Projects - Udacity Data Engineering Poroject</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
In this project, I modeled user activity data collected from a music streaming app with SQL Postgres and NoSQL Apache Cassandra. I completed an ETL pipeline using Python. I have to define fact and dimension tables for a Star Schema for a specific focus for Postgres database. To complete the project, I modeled the same data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I created an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
More details of each project is in the ReadMe files inside each project folder.
